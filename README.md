## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed

### âœ… Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
- **Objective:** Classify iris flowers into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) based on petal & sepal measurements.  
- **Dataset:** Iris Dataset (UCI / scikit-learn).  
- **Process:**
  - Loaded and explored dataset.
  - Preprocessed (checked missing values, duplicates, scaling).
  - Split into training & testing sets.
  - Trained classifiers: **KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree**.
  - Evaluated with **Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix**.  
- **Skills Gained:** Data preprocessing, numeric data analysis, classification modeling, evaluation metrics.

### âœ… Task 2: Spam Mail Detector
- **Objective:** Build a classifier to detect spam vs non-spam (ham) messages.  
- **Dataset:** SMS Spam Collection (UCI).  
- **Process:**
  - Loaded dataset (spam/ham labels).
  - Preprocessed text (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization).
  - Converted text into numeric features (**Bag of Words**).
  - Split into training & testing sets.
  - Trained models: **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.
  - Evaluated with **Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score**.  
- **Skills Gained:** Text preprocessing, feature extraction, NLP basics, classification.
